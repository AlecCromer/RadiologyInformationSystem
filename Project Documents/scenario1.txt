Darius breaks a femur and his doctor, Patty, sends a work order (RIS processes the request) to the technician on duty, Hector, to begin processing the tasks (Technician notified of request from RIS)
 and send the appointment day and time to Darius to confirm.  Hector then takes pictures of the femur (Stored in PACS automatically). Karen (Radiologist) stores her report into RIS, 
 that then lets Patty access the report from Karen. Darius then goes back to Patty to show Darius.
