Lisa was playing outside with her dog and fell fracturing her fibula. She decides to go to a clinic to get an x-ray to see why she is in 
so much pain. She arrives at the clinic and Bobby the administrative assistant asks her does she have an appointment. Lisa tells him she 
doesn’t have appointment but believes she broke something and wants to get x-rayed to find out for sure. Bobby accesses RIS and doesn’t 
see her information in the system and that she wasn’t referred by a physician. Bobby then lets Lisa know that without a referral no one 
can perform an image studying on her, this is due to needing to allocate the proper resources in order to ensure the patient can be 
accommodate. Bobby also lets her know that only certified technicians can use their machines due to the polices put in place by the 
manufactures. Lisa clearly mad at this point leaves limping, headed to see her doctor to get the referral she needs in order to get x-
rayed.
